# BioSeqAnalyzer - Basic Sequence Analysis Tool

BioSeqAnalyzer is a Python-based tool that enables users to perform basic sequence analysis on DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The tool calculates statistics, performs transcription and translation, searches for motifs, generates reverse complements, and supports batch processing of multiple sequences.

## Features

- Calculate sequence length, GC content, AT content, and molecular weight.
- Transcribe DNA sequences to RNA.
- Translate DNA or RNA sequences to protein.
- Search for motifs within sequences.
- Generate reverse complements of DNA sequences.
- Batch processing of multiple sequences.
- Export analysis results to text files.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Biopython library (install using `pip install biopython`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/amenbatool/BioSeqAnalyzer.git
cd BioSeqAnalyzer

2. Run the script: python bioseq_analyzer.py
3. 
3. Follow the on-screen menu to perform sequence analysis.
